# Hi, I'm Yves üëãüèª

üéì I'm French, 26 yo, I studied Robotics at [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.qschina.cn/universities/ecole-polytechnique-f%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale-de-lausanne/). I work on AI for biochemistry at the Herschlag lab at Stanford, more specifically on solving the RNA folding problem. I am interested in generative AI and I did a couple of hackathons for fun. 

## RNA structure prediction

**eFold**: eFold model architecture and training. Uses Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, Vast.ai, W&B and HuggingFace. [code](https://github.com/rouskinlab/efold), [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.24.577093v1.full)

**SEISMIC-RNA**: a data processing tool for DMS-MaPseq. [code](https://github.com/rouskinlab/seismic-rna)

**SEISMOGRAPH**: a visualization webapp compatible with SEISMIC-RNA and shape-mapper. Also available as a python API. [code](https://github.com/rouskinlab/seismic-graph) 

**DMS-CI**: Confidence intervals for the DMS signal (a chemical probing method for RNA structure). [code](https://github.com/rouskinlab/dms_ci)

**RouskinHF**: a wrapper around HuggingFace for data pre-processing, storaging and versioning. [code](https://github.com/rouskinlab/rouskinhf), [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.24.577093v1.full)

**RNAstructure**: a wrapper in Python around David Mathew's RNAstructure. [code](https://github.com/rouskinlab/rnastructure)

## Robotics

**Soft robots sensing**: a proprioceptive method for soft robotic arms using IMUs. [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/State-Estimator-for-Soft-Arm-SESA), [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9982185) 

**Robogami**: a robot made of flexible hinges and rigid tiles. Paper submitted! [firmware](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/RRL_pouch_motors_control) 

**Crazyfly controller**: a quadcopter navigation project [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/CrazyFlie-Control) 

**CPG for bipeds**: a Central-Pattern Generator controller for bipeds. It's a mix of feed-forward and feedback control. [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/CPG-based-control-for-biped).

## LLM

**subliminAI**: embed hidden messages into diffusion models by biasing the seed. [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/subliminAI)

**cringe.ai**: an halloween multimodel that makes spooky comments about your looks. [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/cringe.ai)

## Data science and AI

**Predicting civil war**: use economical, social and military historical data to predict civil war onset. [code](https://mlecauchois.github.io/cwonset/) 

**Seizure-detection app**: An android app to detect seizure using an MLP hosted on Google Compute Engine. [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/Seizure-Detection-Android-App). 

## Embedded electronics

**Meeting optimizer**: a system made of an app, a webapp and a device to optimize meeting attendance.  [project](https://chi.camp/projects/team-3-2019-2020/), [firmware](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/Odeji-Firmware-Arduino), [WebApp](https://odeji-6a294.web.app/) 

**InVu**: a connected mirror for health monitoring [code](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/smartMirrorFitbit).
