# Hi, I'm Yves 👋🏻

🎓 I just graduated from EPFL, Switzerland in Robotics. 

🤖 I worked on the control of drones and legged robots, soft robots, and a machine learning app to detect if your grandpa has a heart seizure. 

📜 To finish my degree, I did my master's thesis at Harvard Microrobotics Lab. Check out my paper's repo, it was published at IROS!

🧬 I'm super interested in biology and I love doing research, so I joined the Herschlag lab at Stanford! At the moment, I'm implementing a data processing pipeline called DREEM - check out the repo!

⏭️ Next step, I want to work on a project merging biology and robotics!
