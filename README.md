# Hi, I'm Yves 👋🏻

🎓 I just graduated from EPFL, Switzerland in Robotics. 

🤖 I worked on the control of drones and legged robots, soft robots, and a machine learning app to detect if your grandpa has a heart seizure. 

📜 To finish my degree, I did my master's thesis at Harvard Microrobotics Lab. Check out my paper's repo, it was published at IROS!

🧬 I'm super interested in biology and I love doing research, so I joined the Herschlag lab at Stanford! At the moment, I'm implementing a data processing pipeline called DREEM - check out the repo!

⏭️ Next step, I want to get into a PhD program merging biology and robotics!

🧬 DREEM: an implementation of Dr. Silvi Rouskin's ![DREEM method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310298/). DREEM stands for **D**etection of **R**NA folding **E**nsembles using **E**xpectation-**M**aximization, and is a high-throughput method to probe chemically the secondary structure of RNA sequences.

🧬 DREEM-PPAI: a simple module to add features to the output of ![Joe Yesselmann's DREEM](https://github.com/jyesselm/dreem).

🧬 DREEM-HERSCHLAG: a wrapper for ![Joe Yesselmann's DREEM](https://github.com/jyesselm/dreem), including DREEM-PPAI's features.
