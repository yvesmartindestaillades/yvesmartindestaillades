# Hi, I'm Yves 👋🏻

🎓 I just graduated from EPFL, Switzerland in Robotics. 

🤖 I worked on soft robotics for my master's thesis at Harvard Microrobotics Lab. Check out [my paper's repo](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/State-Estimator-for-Soft-Arm-SESA), it was published at IROS!

the control of [drones](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/CrazyFlie-Control) and [legged robots](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/CPG-based-control-for-biped).

💻 I'm also super interested in data science and AI. I worked on [predicting civil war](https://mlecauchois.github.io/cwonset/) and developed [an app that uses a Multi-Layers Perceptron to detect if you have a heart seizure](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/Seizure-Detection-Android-App). 

💡 I like IoTs and I built a meeting-optimizer called [Odeji](https://chi.camp/projects/team-3-2019-2020/). The code for the firmware is [here](https://github.com/yvesmartindestaillades/Odeji-Firmware-Arduino), and it's connected to a [WebApp](https://odeji-6a294.web.app/) whose code is here.


🧬 I'm super interested in biology and I love doing research, so I joined the Herschlag lab at Stanford! At the moment, I'm implementing a data processing pipeline called DREEM - [check out the repo](https://github.com/rouskinlab/DREEM)!

🪞 Just for fun, I'm developing a connected mirror for health monitoring. It's still work in progress
